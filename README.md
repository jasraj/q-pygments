## q-pygments

> A Pygments syntax highlighter extension for q

This repo provides a lexer (and sample q file) to add to the [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) Python syntax highlighter.

The main driver for providing this is to allow Pygments to parse q on a blog served by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
